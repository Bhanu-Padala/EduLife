<h3>Traditional Education (Classical Approach)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students are not exposed to practical problems which they come across in day-to-day life. The role of the teacher is restricted merely to the transmission of information that he has learned from his predecessors without making any effort for its application in real-life scenarios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Modern Education (Pragmatic Approach)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teachers used to be isolated as repositories of knowledge who impart information gathered over the years through their personal experiences and observations. They used to tell their students what is right or wrong but never explain how it can be put to use in real-life situations. This is where the role of teachers has changed and now their focus is on teaching students how to apply knowledge in practical settings.</p>

<h2>Condition of Modern Education in Pakistan</h2>

The education sector of our country suffers from different problems due to the lack of proper implementation of reforms.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the reason students are encouraged to focus on art at the pre-college level because it helps in the development of <strong>creative thinking skills which is equally important</strong> in both quantitative and qualitative fields.
