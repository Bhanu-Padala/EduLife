<p>Learning methods are constantly improving, relying more and more on modern technology. This advances communication, facilitates the acquiring of information and makes it easier to explain the subject matter. These are only some of the ways technology is used in education today.</p>

<p>Thanks to the educational methods of the 21st century, it is easier for the teachers to impart knowledge, as well as recognize their students’ potential. On the other hand, the students’ learning itself is hugely facilitated through the use of audio-visual and interactive software and gadgets. This strategic synergy of technology and teaching is what opens up new possibilities in education, and some methods have stood out as especially noteworthy.</p>

<h2>Distance learning</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Distance education as a form of education has been used for decades, but it has gained importance with the rapid advancement of the means of communication. Now it is possible to attend class in real time from another end of the planet, and even actively participate. The prerequisites for online education are an internet connection and a computer or another smart device, and adequate communication software. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology in education provides virtual attendance, live chat, as well as face to face communication with teachers and students in real time. One can also access the previously recorded lessons, as well as a wealth of other materials necessary for studying. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This learning method is used at many American schools, sometimes as an additional method of teaching and sometimes on its own, as full-time online learning. The possibilities have expanded so much that it is now even possible to attend the school’s extracurricular activities in this manner. And in the end, at many schools across the USA, one can even graduate in this way.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Computers and tablets in classrooms</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would an education without books look like? This question is easy to answer – all information would be placed on a tablet (or computer). The digitization of educational content would facilitate access to information, while hard-copy textbooks would no longer be relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, computers and tablets help in the following ways:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>they make education literally lighter (no heavy bags)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>ease of access anytime, from anywhere</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>they provide a high level of computer literacy</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>they facilitate studying through allowing children to use multimedia materials</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>getting familiar with new technologies from an early age serves as excellent preparation for further education</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>computer-based testing makes knowledge assessment easier for teachers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, in order for all this to be possible, students and teachers must have access to tablets or computers, so that modern methods of education could be equally available to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Cloud technology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best examples of the usefulness of learning technology is the implementation of cloud technology. Earlier use of computers in education was limited, as the sharing of data was comparatively complicated. Nowadays, school devices are interconnected using online software that keeps data in a cloud. This means that all information available on the server is accessible to all students.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it is much easier to solve team tasks, and share information and multimedia using cloud services such as Office365 or Google Drive. There are also specific educational apps that introduce children to this type of data exchange. The additional benefit of these cloud services is the price, which is a lot lower than that of buying specific software for each school device. This technology is especially important in eLearning, when a teacher uploads assignments and multimedia content for students.</p>

<h2>VR technology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are relatively new advancements in technology that bring a new dimension to the classroom. Using VR headgear, students can visit remote areas and encounter ancient civilizations or dinosaurs. This is an excellent supplement in the learning process, where one can gain close experiences not feasible in reality (climbing a mountain, going to space).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, augmented reality entails an “enhancement” of reality, where digital elements are blended with real ones, which positively affects student engagement. Perhaps the most popular example of AR technology around the world is the game Pokémon GO, where the players walk on actual streets looking for the creatures from the game. This technology is useful in areas other than gaming, and there is no doubt that the possibilities that this powerful tool brings along are a part of the fabric of the future of education.</p>

<h2>Robotics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to facilitating the learning process, new technology helps students get acquainted with the world of modern work through problem solving. School science projects are reimagined through the introduction of robotics, programming and 3D printing. These are the foundations of many professions that are already popular on the job market, with a great potential for future growth and expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robotics helps students get acquainted with all branches of the STEM system (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), which opens the door to future professional advancements. Creating a robot does not mean only designing it and making its parts through 3D printing, but also programming its behavior. This might sound complicated, but at many schools, even the younger students are introduced to the basics of robotics and other technological advancements (according to age and intellectual development).</p>

<h2>Technology is an indispensable part of modern education</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Education technology constitutes the foundation of contemporary development and advancement of students. Encountering gadgets, programming and modern means of communication at an early age makes it much easier to adopt new standards and methods of work later. This is why more and more schools are modernizing in order to keep up with 21st century education methods. This is a great way to prepare the children for the challenges that await in the future, and a great asset when it comes to the ease of fulfilling their school obligations.</p>
